*Implementation checklist*

If you're using this boilerplate package in a production site, here's a little list of things to update out of the box:

* Have you customised your page title?
* Have you customised your meta tags?
* Have you customised the Open Graph tags?
* Have you filled in your robots.txt and humans.txt files?
* Have you added a favicon and web app icons as necessary?
* Have you updated the DD_belatedPNG selector to properly pick out your transparent PNGs?
* Have you updated the Google Analytics code to include the correct site ID?

* Lastly, you might want to clean up the following files, so nobody will know you used this package, muahaha: CHECKLIST.textile (this file), LICENSE, README.textile
