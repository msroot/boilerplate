h1. boilerplate

h5. by BigglesZX

Inspired by the rather super "HTML5 Boilerplate":http://html5boilerplate.com/ but with a load of my own wild and probably irresponsible customisations.

A few features...
* HTML5, natch
* IE-sniffing classes on html tag, for tidy IE fixes
* (also includes stub IE8/IE7/IE6 stylesheets loaded with conditional comments; you can use one or the other)
* sensible basic meta tags, including Open Graph data stubs
* stub robots.txt, humans.txt and favicon/iOS web app icon references
* basic reset (Meyer 2.0) stylesheet with a few sensible additions, plus stub print stylesheet
* stub mobile stylesheet with 480px media query and desktop-only/mobile-only hiding rules
* head.js loader to asynchronously load jQuery, Modernizr dev build and custom behavioural JS (stub)
* for IE, IE Print Protector and Selectivizr are loaded with head.js too (you can remove IEPP if you include it in your own Modernizr build)
* for IE6, DD_belatedPNG is loaded too
* Google Analytics stub

Share and enjoy...
